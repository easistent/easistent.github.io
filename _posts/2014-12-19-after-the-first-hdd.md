HDD or **Happy Developers Day** is a project that grew out of HDH, that means **Happy Developers Hour**. 

Every thursday our team of developers gathers together for an hour of knowledge exchange and beer. The HDD project expands this to one full day (24 hours) ands adds hacking new projects.

Every developer choose a project. Something that would not be done in the normal development cycle, something that she or he wanted to do. It didn't had to be an extension of an existing project.

At the end we got 9 excelent new experiments that could be used in our future projects or released under an opensource licence.

**P.S. ** On the pictures seems that we were eating all the time. No, just 1/3 of the time, but food looks better on picture than a gun in front of a computer. :D
