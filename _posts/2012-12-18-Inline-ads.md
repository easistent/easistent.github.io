In 2006 I wrote a simple ads system that searches articles for keywords and puts graphical ads in them. It is a combination of Google Adsense and graphical ads that is not intrusive for the user but generates many views and clicks on related content.

You can see how it looks here in the image below:

This script was used on a production site for about two years in combination with standard ads. This is the same code with some light rewrites so it's a little less ugly. 

It's light with no requirements except for the server side, that can be easily rewritten in something else. Now it's PHP and MySQL.

If you're interested, you can find it on [github]().
