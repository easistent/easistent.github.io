Hello!

Are you here? Knock, knock! Look here, yes this way! Yes, you! Eeeeey!

Ok, you can see me now. Let's begin...
<!--break-->
I'm **Marko Milost - McLion**, the Scrum Master at e≈†ola. A company specialized in software solutions for schools (K12). 

The company exists for some years and is most known for [eAsistent](https://www.easistent.com) - a web solution that made paper gradebooks and school journals redundant in Slovenia. We've also contributed in optimizing many other processes in schools.

Now we've decided to made our development a little more open. We'll share some of our knowledge here, some of our processes (like Scrum) and code too. 

So this is the first post. Come back soon for more. :)
